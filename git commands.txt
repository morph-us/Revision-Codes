git init

git status

git remote add origin <remote_path>  
 : origin is URL of remote repository on github
git remote -v


set upstream:

git branch --set-upstream-to origin/main


git add . /   git add --all 
git commit -m "commit message"
git push --set-upstream origin master /  git push

to unset upstream : git branch --unset-upstream


git branch <branch_name>
git checkout <branch_name> // git checkout -b <branch_name>
git branch -a (show all)
git branch -a -v (show all with their upstreams)


git merge <branch_name>
git diff <branch_name>


delete remote :  git push -d <branch_name>
delete local brancg : git branch -d <branch_name> 


//github has renames master branch to main but git by default creates main at local host
pulling from main to master creates conflicts while pushing
git push origin master (creates new branch at origin)
git push origin main(gives error) 
so rename local repo to main and then push

'''
git branch -m master main \
git push -u origin main \
git remote set-head origin main
'''

or 
git push origin HEAD:main works even if you dont have a main branch at local repo . but why ??(maybe it pushes HEAD directly to main in remote)


what is HEAD in git ?
head points to latest commit of current branch


    git push origin HEAD

    A handy way to push the current branch to the same name on the remote.
