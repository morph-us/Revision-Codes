refrence works as alternative name for a variable.
it is internally a pointer but we do not need to dereference it/
it helps as we do not need to create another copy of same object while passing it to a function.
refernce is used in copy constructor.
it can also be used in for each loop, it saves memory

refernce cannot be updated.
reference has only single level of indirection.
it cannot be NULL
